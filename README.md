# MELD Score (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) (12 and older)
https://www.mdcalc.com/meld-score-model-end-stage-liver-disease-12-older#evidence

With the following Variables

Creatinine (mg/dL) Norm = 0.7-1.3
Cr >4.0 mg/dL is automatically assigned a value of 4.0

Bilirubin (mg/dL) Norm = 0.3-1.9

INR Norm 1-2

Sodium (mEq/L) Norm 136-145

FORMULA Per OPTN policy, January 2016 (pages 4–5):

Candidates who are at least 12 years old receive an initial MELD(i) score equal to:

**MELD(i) = 0.957 × ln(Cr) + 0.378 × ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 × ln(INR) + 0.643**

Then, round to the tenth decimal place and multiply by 10. Maximum MELD = 40.

If MELD(i) > 11, perform additional MELD calculation as follows:

**MELD = MELD(i) + 1.32 × (137 – Na) –  [ 0.033 × MELD(i) × (137 – Na) ]**

Additional rules:

All values in US units (Cr and bilirubin in mg/dL, Na in mEq/L, and INR unitless).
    
    If bilirubin, Cr, or INR is <1.0, use 1.0.
    
    If any of the following is true, use Cr 4.0:
    
          Cr >4.0.
    
          ≥2 dialysis treatments within the prior 7 days.
    
          24 hours of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) within the prior 7 days.
    
    If Na <125 mmol/L, use 125. If Na >137 mmol/L, use 137.
